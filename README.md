# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## User Story
A traveler wants to check a weather forecast of multiple cities before his trip. 
The traveler will be able to see the forecast of every 3 hours for the next 5 days. 
The App has to save a history of the traveler's previous searches, for future reference.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. The 5 day forecast is divided by runs of 3 hours.
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
